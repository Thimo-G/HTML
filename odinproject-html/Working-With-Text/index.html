    <h1>Paragraphs</h1>

    <p>I am trying to create two paragraphs here.</p> 

    <p>Now a space is added with a p-element </p> 

    <br> <!-- This adds a blank line here-->
    <br>
    <br>

    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>

    <br>
    <br>
    <!-- Do not use <b> and <i> as they dont make the text more important for screen readers-->
    <p>Here I use  <strong> the strong element </strong> to make the text bold and also mark it as important for screen readers for example.</p>
    <p>I can also use a combination of <strong> strong</strong> and the <em> em element</em> (which makes text italic and emphasised it) to create <strong><em>this</em></strong>.</p>
